# SNS Bot

This is a very simple RAG application for answering queries on the [Service Nervous System](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/overview). 

Data used for the embeddings can be found in `data/` and the actual embeddings can be found in `embeddings.csv`.

A `.env` file with an OpenAI API Key must be located in the directory with the `OPENAI_API_KEY` key defined for the application to work.
